# Capture and Analyze Network Traffic with Wireshark
- This task involved using Wireshark to capture and analyze live network traffic on system.  to identify different network protocols, filter packet data, and understand the types of traffic generated by common internet activities 


# procedure/steps:
##  installing wireshark
-   installed Wireshark on my Kali Linux virtual machine using the following command:
    -          sudo apt install wireshark

-  install Wireshark on Windows using command (as Admin):
   -      choco install wireshark
- Direct download link :  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html



## Starting Packet Capture
- launch Wireshark and selected the active network interface:
- Selected the active network interface (usually eth0 for wired or wlan0 for wireless)
- Clicked "Start capturing packets" button  for start-capturing
- the capturing process  run for approximately 1-2 minutes to collect sufficient data.
- stop the packet capture in Wireshark by clicking the red "Stop" button.


Protocol Analysis
I identified and filtered the following protocols:
## HTTP Traffic :

-  Found HTTP requests to various websites
-  Observed GET requests and responses

## DNS Traffic:

- Captured DNS queries and responses
- Identified A record lookups for domain names

## TCP Traffic:


- Observed TCP handshakes (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Connection establishment and teardown

## ICMP Traffic:

- Captured ping requests and replies
- Echo request/reply packets

### Summary of captured protocols:

- HTTP packets:  - Web traffic
- DNS packets: - Domain name resolution
- TCP packets: - Reliable connection-oriented traffic
- ICMP packets:- Network diagnostic traffic
