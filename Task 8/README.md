#  Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
   A simple browser hygiene project focused on identifying and removing suspicious or potentially harmful extensions to improve browser security and performance.

# Objective
##  The purpose of this project is to:

 -  Audit installed browser extensions

 -  Remove extensions that pose privacy, security, or performance risks


# Tools:
  Browser: Google Chrome (This guide also applies to Firefox with slight interface differences.)

# Other Resources:

- Google Search (for reputation checks)

# Extension permission details
## Steps
